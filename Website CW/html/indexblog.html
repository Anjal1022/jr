						<q>“I think the internet is really good in generaL because it helps people get access to more information.</q>

						<h2>What is internet?</h2><br>

						<!--Short paragraph about content-->
						<p>  The Internet is a broader network that allows companies, governments, academics and other organisations' around worldwide to communicate to one other. This results in a network of cables, computers, data centers, routers, servers and repeaters that allow digital information to move across the world through satellites and Wifi towers.
                        The Internet has reversed our lives. Their communications have changed to the point that they are now our favorite media for verbal life. We use the Internet in practically all of our activities. Order a meal, purchase a things and send a photo over immediate messages, share with friends.
                        Today, however, a click or two is sufficient to 
                        update your local paper and any information source from anywhere in the globe.The internet was enlarged over the 1980s and 1990s to include the IT capabilities of universities, research centres, and later on, corporate and governmental organisations from all over the world. It was no longer a state-controlled project, but the world's largest computer network, which includes 50 000 subsystems, four million systems and seventy million users. 
                        The Internet was undergoing amazing array.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Internet was no longer a sophisticated interdisciplinary instrument for creating content, communication between individuals and even for escaping reality. The Internet is no longer a single interchange of information. Today, in a matter of seconds, we are able to transmit data from one end of the planet to the other, exhibit them online, live in parallel games and utilize images, video, music and text to reveal our true lives, our authentic identitude. 
                            Personal tales are publicly available; local concerns are global.

                            IT has critical thinking changes in society and moved it from an industrial age to a networked one. Global information networks in our world are essential infrastructure, but how have these relationships changed? 
                            The internet has altered business, education, government, health care and even the way we communicate with our loved ones, making them one of the most important forces for societal development.
                            According to industry analysts almost everyone from a software design company to the largest producer, to the tiniest "mommy & pop" store, requires the IT staff so that their companies may operate properly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The use of PCs to store, recover, transmit, and regulate data is Information Technology(IT). In addition to individual or distraction technologies, IT is often used within the framework of business duties.
                                In contrast to technology for personal or leisure purposes, IT is often utilized in the context of corporate activities. Computer technology and telecommunication are the business uses of IT.
                                Usually, the phrase is used as an analogous word for PCs and PC systems, but also for other advances in data dispersion, such as TV and phones. A number of products, including PC devices, programming, hardware and semiconductor systems, the web, telecommunications equipment and electronic commerce are associated with data innovations.
                                The word IT has expanded to include a variety of technologies and associated fields. IT still includes basic computerized information systems, such as computing, OSes, software and processed data for valuable information. IT still includes basic computational information systems. Over time, each component and function of these IT technologies and methods has gotten increasingly sophisticated by incorporating ever developing subsets of technology.
                                For instance, application development started as a very linear process in which system analysts and programmers developed code for a business goal. It has become a more cooperative and organic process that encompasses the production of applications such as DevOps and the agile development of software.
                                Even OS — the fundamental code that works for servers and client computers — has taken on new dimensions. The link between OSes and host hardware has broken or, at least, modified technologies such as virtualization and containerization. As a consequence, IT is no longer only locally; cloud computing environments now supplement and replace the traditional data center resources on-site.
                        </p>
                        <p>All these advances have made IT more complicated and needed higher expertise and additional IT staff jobs and duties.</p>

						<h2>Impacts Of Internet and Information Technology</h2><br>
                        <!--Short paragraph about content-->
						<p>
                            The Internet is the critical information age technology, because the electric engine was the vector of industrial technological development. This worldwide computer network, which presently relies mostly on wireless communication systems, enables multimodal, interactive communication capabilities in the selected time and location. The Internet is not actually new; in 1969 it was initially deployed in its progenitor, the Arpanet (Abbate 1999).  
                            It was in the 1990s, however, that it was privatized and freed from US control. Commercial Department, which spread worldwide with exceptional speed: the first survey of Internet users in 1996 was around 40 million; in 2013, it was more than 2,5 billion; China accounted for the biggest number of internet users.
                            Moreover, for some time the difficulties to establish terrestrial telecommunications infrastructure in emerging nations has hampered the growth of the internet. This changed in the early 21st century with the growth of wireless communication. Indeed, over 16 million cellular customers worldwide in 1991 and around 7 billion in 2013 (in a planet of 7.7 billion human beings).
                            Taking into account familial and local usage of mobile phones and the fact that children under the age of five are limited in usage, we can claim that the human race is now virtually totally linked, though with high levels of bandwidth disparity as well as efficiency and service prices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We should remember that technology is material culture if we want to comprehend completely the influence of the Internet on society. Through a particular institutional setting, it is developed in a social process on the basis of their producers' ideas, values, interests and expertise, both their initial producers and their succeeding producers. In this process the users of the technology must be included who adapt and adjust the technology rather than accept it, so modifying it and making it a permanent process of interaction between technological and social creation.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, to assess the relevance of Internet in society we must recall the specific characteristics of Internet as a technology. Then we must place it in the context of the transformation of the overall social structure, as well as in relationship to the culture characteristic of this social structure. Indeed, we live in a new social structure, the global network society, characterized by the rise of a new culture, the culture of autonomy.
                        </p>
